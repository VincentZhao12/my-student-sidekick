# Web app idea I had, basically its a bunch of useful stuff for students

-   grade calculator
-   schudueling thing?
-   note taker
-   bibliography thing

# if i get enough users i might implement social stuff

-   messaging
-   supply lending
-   assignment feedback
-   quizlet like thing for studying
-   lost and found thing so people can post things that people lost
-   sharing study materials

this is very ambitious so if i stop adding things i've probably given up

to run clone repo, ask me for environment vars and

```
npm install
npm start
```
